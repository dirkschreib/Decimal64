# Comparison of decimal floating-point types in Swift

This is a small project which compares two different implementations for a Swift `Decimal64` struct against the builtin types Double and Decimal.

## DecimalFP64

This is a struct which conforms to the `FloatingPoint` protocol. (It compiles fine but not all functions are implemented)
It tries to follow IEEE 754 as closely as possible and supports +/- Infinity, signed zeros and NaNs.

Internal structure:

Part | Bits | Comment 
-|-|-
Sign | 63          | separate bit
Exponent | 54..62  | with room for NaN and Inf
Significand | 0..53| 16 decimal digits


## Decimal64

This struct doesn't conform to the `FloatingPoint` protocol and uses a different internal representation of the numbers.
It has no support for +/- Infinity, uses a 2's complement for negative numbers (i.e. no signed zeros) and ignores NaNs.

Internal structure:

Part | Bits | Comment
-|-|-
Significand | 9..63 | 16 decimal digits and sign
Exponent | 0..8 | 

## Decimal (builtin, for reference)

This is an Apple provided struct with 160bit. Does not conform to the `FloatingPoint` protocol.

## Double (builtin, for reference)

Internal floating-point type with 64bit.

# Performance

To test the performance of a few basic operations (+,*,/ and conversion to string)
a small benchmark was used to compare the four different types.

As `Double` and `DecimalFP64` both conformed to the `FloatingPoint` protocol, these were tested with a generic version too.

Testing was concluded with Xcode 10.2.1 on an iMac (Retina 5K, 27", 2017) with 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7 and macOS Mojave 10.14.5

**Update** for version v1.1: `Decimal64` and `DecimalFP64` now conform to the `TextOutputStreamable` protocol.

Number Type                  | Debug  | Release | rel.  | Debug v1.1 | Release v1.1 | rel. 
-|-|-|-|-|-|-
`Double`                            | 0.100s | 0.094s |  -5%  | 0.102s | 0.095s | -9%
`Decimal`                          | 0.427s | 0.417s |  -2%   | 0.427s | 0.417s | -3%
`DecimalFP64`                  | 0.784s | 0.101s | -87%  | 0.481s | 0.079s | -84%
`Decimal64`                      |  0.543s | 0.102s | -81% | 0.521s | 0.078s | -85%
`Double` (generic)             | 0.137s | 0.124s |  -8%   | 0.137s | 0.125s | -10%
`DecimalFP64` (generic)   | 0.850s | 0.151s | -82%  | 0.529s | 0.110s | -79%

Key findings v1.0:
- The debug performance didn't look very promising, but llvm can optimize this code very well.
- The difference between the two new implementations is negligible.
- There is a very bad performance penalty if someone tries to use numbers in a generic way.
  (i.e. protocol witness overhead)
  **Update**
  After discussion on https://forums.swift.org/t/performance-overhead-for-protocols/27104 Joe Groff opened https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-11158 (i.e. rdar://problem/53285593)
- The own implementation is just 5% slower than the builtin `Double` (which is unsuitable for most currency calculations)

Key findings v1.1:
- I have never heard of `TextOutputStreamable` before. (Thanks Brent!) This is tremendous performance benefit.
- `DecimalFP64` and `Decimal64` are now faster than `Double`. They need 18% less time to complete the benchmark test.
- The performance difference to `Decimal` is even higher: The benchmark test is completed in 1/5th of the time.
